    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Do you love oatmeal, but swear it off during the hot summer months because the thought of eating a steamy bowl of oatmeal makes you sweat just thinking about it?</p>
    <p>Overnight oats are the solution, and I'm here to help! Overnight oats are so easy to prepare and the combinations of flavors are truly endless</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup dairy, almond, cashew, or other milk of choice</li>
            <li>1/2 old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup yogurt (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp chia seeds (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 banana, mashed (optional)</li>
            <li>Serving suggestions: fruit (fresh or dried), nuts, nut butter, seeds, protein powder, granola, coconut, spices, citrus zest and vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the desired amounts of milk, oats, yogurt, chia seeds and banana to a jar or container and give them a good stir. Refrigerate overnight or for at least 5 hours. </li>
            <li>In the morning, add additional liquid if you'd like. Once you achieve the desired consistency, top with fruit, nuts, nut butter, seeds, protein powder, granola, coconut, spices, zest or vanilla extract.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Special Note</h4>
    <p>The mixture will keep for up to 2 days. If you don't add the banana, up to 4 days. However, once you are experienced, you'll have no problem whipping up another batch midweek if needed!</p>
