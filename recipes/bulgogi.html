        <h1>Bulgogi</h1>
        <img class="bulgogipic" src="../img/bulgogi.jpg" alt="a delicious bowl of beef">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the true definition of a “meal in-a-bowl”: 
            marinated beef Bulgogi, pickled cucumbers, spicy 
            kimchi and a fried egg, all served atop a bed of rice. 
            Lunch, dinner and/or leftovers is done!</p>
        <p>The real secret to restaurant-worthy Bulgogi is to very,
             very thinly slice the beef. The thinner it is, the 
             faster it will cook and the more tender and 
             melt-in-your-mouth it will be.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chili garlic sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 tbsp minced ginger</li>
                <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced shallots</li>
                <li>2 pounds ribeye or top sirloin steak, cut into 1/8 inch thick slices</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the sauce by combining the soy sauce, 
                    rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, 
                    ginger, and garlic in a medium bowl. Mix well 
                    and set aside as you prepare the ground beef.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and onion to a skillet and cook
                    it over medium heat. Cook the beef for about 5
                    minutes, or until browned. </li>
                <li>Add the bulgogi sauce to the browned meat and 
                    mix it all together.</li>
                <li>Let it simmer for 6-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>To serve, remove the ground beef bulgogi from 
                    the heat and evenly distribute it between four 
                    bowls.</li>
                <li>Top the beef with scallions, sesame seeds, and 
                    a soft-boiled egg. Enjoy with a side of rice, 
                    quinoa, or in a lettuce wrap.</li>
            </ol>
